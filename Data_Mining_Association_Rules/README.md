# Data Mining : Association Rules

This is a Matlab project that uses two different sets of data (not included in this repo),
the Census Income Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income) and the
MovieLens 100k Movie Rating (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) to generate
association rules. The association rules provide a picture of what a person may like or do
given other information about them. For instance, using the rules generated we can deduce
that if someone likes movie A and movie B, they are likely to like movie C.

The algorithm generates the association rules using the Apriori algorithm.
The program generates two sets of association rules, one based on their interest and
another based on their confidence, and then writes the sets to a txt file for review.
The association rules that were generated by the two datasets are written to the
documents as followed:

  Census Dataset:
    rules_interest.txt
    rules_confidence.txt



  Movie Dataset:
    rules_interest_movie_1.txt
    rules_interest_movie_2.txt
    rules_confidence_movie_1.txt
